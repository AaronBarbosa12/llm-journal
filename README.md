This is a chat application for self-reflection and journaling. This application offers users an interactive experience where they can engage with an AI language model, creating a safe and supportive environment to explore their thoughts and ideas. The user's messages are transmitted to a dedicated Node.js backend, which processes the input and facilitates communication with the Open AI API for generating responses. To further enrich the AI model's understanding and deliver optimal responses, the application utilizes a vector database called Pinecone, which provides contextual information. The frontend of the application is developed using React, while user authentication and data management are handled through Firebase.
